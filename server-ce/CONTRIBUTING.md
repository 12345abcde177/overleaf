==========================

Thank you for reading this! If you've found a bug, or have a new feature in mind,
then here are some notes on how to best report issues or implement changes.

Security
--------

Please do not publish security vulnerabilities publicly until we've had a chance
to address them. All security related issues/patches should be sent directly to
security@sharelatex.com where we will attempt to address them quickly. If you're
unsure whether something is a security issue or not, then please be cautious and
contact us at security@sharelatex.com first.

Reporting bugs
--------------

If you've found a bug then please:

1. Check if there is an existing issue for it. If there is then please add
   any more information that you have, or give it a "+1".
2. If there is there is no issue, then please open one.
3. Please describe the issue as clearly as possible, including how to
   reproduce the bug, which situations it appears in, what you expected to
   happen, and what actually happens.
4. Please include a screenshot for front end issues if you can.

Pull Requests
-------------

We love pull requests, so be bold with them! Don't be afraid of going ahead
and changing something, or adding a new feature. If you're setting of to make
a big change then opening an issue (or commenting on an existing one) is the
best way to discuss your ideas first.
